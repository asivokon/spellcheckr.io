Do you ever feel like Master Yoda?  You are supposedly great and mighty. But
people still hide their smiles when they listen to you.  Why is that?
Because you speak funny! :)

> “Anger, fear, aggression; the dark side of the Force are they.
Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark
path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did
Obi-Wan’s apprentice.”

Suppose Master Yoda used **spellcheckr.io** before he made this speech!
This is what he'd be likely to get:

> “Anger, fear, aggression; they are the dark side of the Force.
They flow easily and are quick to join you in a fight. Once you start down the
dark path, it will forever dominate your destiny, it will consume you, as it
did Obi-Wan’s apprentice.”

Not so funny anymore, huh?
